Milestone 1 – Proposal
Outlined the project concept, goals, target users, and planned features. Described the idea of using live human posture tracking to trigger keyboard inputs.

Milestone 2 – Paper Prototype
Created a UI mock‑up of the settings page and live camera feed page. Demonstrated gesture selection, key binding, and basic workflow. Identified initial usability concerns such as vague gesture descriptions.

Milestone 3 – Early Implementation
Integrated basic camera tracking and displayed a simple skeleton overlay. Added partial gesture detection and an early version of the settings interface. Began testing for accuracy and latency.

Milestone 4 – Final Prototype
Completed full body tracking with nine gestures, added gesture icons, introduced a separate settings page, implemented custom key binding, and provided live visual feedback for tracking accuracy. Final system supports real‑time control of external applications using detected poses.
